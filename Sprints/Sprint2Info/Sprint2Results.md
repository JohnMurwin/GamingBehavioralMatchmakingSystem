**Sprint Forecast**   
During Sprint 1, the group completed 34 Story Points (SP). Forecasting based on Yesterdayâ€™s Weather would put us between 30-40 SP for Sprint 2. However, we noticed a pattern of sparse days during Sprint 1 and determined we could ramp up our Story Points by being more active and consistent with our production. As such, we decided to complete two backlog items (01 Database Systems - 30 SP and 02 User Login - 36 SP). This resulted in a forecast of 66 SP. As time allowed, we also created stretch goals (03 Account Management - 20 SP and 04 Player Profile - 20 SP). Though we did not anticipate completing backlog item 03 or 04.

**Evidence of Testing**

**CI/CD Systems**
 Our team was incapable of providing a Continuous Integration System nor a Continuous Development System during this sprint. This was mostly due to large amounts of outside circumstances that were forcing our attention away from this project. Several of our members are currently working full time jobs as well as taking multiple classes. Some are currently experiencing or have experienced family medical emergencies that required their immediate attention. These reasons, coupled with that many of our members are unfamiliar with web/app development and are having to learn, are why we were unable to provide this project with the time and attention it has required up to this point. Thankfully, many of these issues have been or are being resolved and will allow us to divert our time and attention to completing this project to the best of our ability. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have questions.
