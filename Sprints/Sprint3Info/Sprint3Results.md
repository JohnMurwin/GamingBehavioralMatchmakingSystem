**Sprint Forecast**   
The goal was to finish backlog items 02-05, which was originally estimated to be about 130 Story Points. If time allowed, the group had stretch goals to complete backlog items 06 and 07. As work progressed, we saw that the backlogs Story Points were underestimated and required significantly more time. During the sprint, items 02-04 reached completion. 05 is a prototype of how the algorithm would match players within the database. Backlog items 06 and 07 remained tabled until the next sprint.
